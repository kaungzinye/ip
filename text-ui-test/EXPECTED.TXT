   Even with my Six Eyes, I can't tell what the name of your task is... BECAUSE IT'S EMPTY! WRITE IT AGAIN IDIOT!

   You either got no /by or name for your deadline.. I don't know when your thing ends, a sorcerer should always chant when they cast their spell.
   ____________________________________________________________

   ____________________________________________________________
   Your formatting for the date of deadline is wrong or your date is invalid. It should be dd/MM/yyyy HHmm. Try again..
   ____________________________________________________________

   ____________________________________________________________
   Where's your /from (start date)? Can't have an event without the start time, just like how Purple needs Blue.
   ____________________________________________________________

   ____________________________________________________________
   Where's your /to (end date)? Can't have an event without the ending time, just like how Purple needs red.
   ____________________________________________________________

   ____________________________________________________________
   Your formatting and/or the timings of the event is wrong. It should be dd/MM/yyyy HHmm. Try again..
   ____________________________________________________________

   ____________________________________________________________
   The start date/time must be before the end date/time. Please provide valid timings.
   ____________________________________________________________

   ____________________________________________________________
   My Six Eyes I can't find your task, because you it doesn't exist you idiot.
   Not surprised since I'm stronger than you..
   Try again...
